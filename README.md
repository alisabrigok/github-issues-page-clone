# Fully Functional Github Issues Page (I mean, sort of)

### Lack Of Things Because Of The Time Constrains:

  - Obviously, the bonus section of the challenge,
  - More and smarter tests,
  - Less repeated logic. i.e. using HOC for select components,
  - Better error handling; user friendly messages, error boundaries implementation,
  - Exact assignee image animation as Github page - right now it just prints assignee images side by side,
  - Notice icon and assignee image hover popup message

But that was the best I could do within given time.

Thanks for the time spent reviewing.
