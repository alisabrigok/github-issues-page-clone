# Fully Functional Github Issues Page (I mean, sort of)

### Lack Of The Things Because Of The Time Constrains:

- More and smarter testing
- Obviously, the bonus section of the challenge,
- Using HOC for select components,
- Error boundaries implementation,
- Using SVGs as components and styling them dynamically,
- Exact assignee image animation as Github page - right now it just prints assignee images side by side,
- Notice icon and assignee image hover popup message,
- Filter selection indication with tick icon instead of blue background

But that was the best I could do within given time.

**Final note**: I pushed the code just now and realized that label filter is a multi-selection on GitHub. Unfortunately I built having single selection in mind.

Thanks for the time spent reviewing.
