# Fully Functional Github Issues Page (I mean, sort of)

### Lack Of Things Because Of The Time Constrains:

- More and smarter testing
- Obviously, the bonus section of the challenge,
- Using HOC for select components,
- Error boundaries implementation,
- Using SVGs as components and styling them dynamically
- Exact assignee image animation as Github page - right now it just prints assignee images side by side,
- Notice icon and assignee image hover popup message
- Tick icon indicator for label selection

But that was the best I could do within given time.

Thanks for the time spent reviewing.
